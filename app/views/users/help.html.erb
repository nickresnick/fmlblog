        Is it me, or is the "Help" tab at the top of the screen for most application almost never helpful?
        Like honestly it's a glorified searchlight feature for the app. Yes, it does offer to take you to some online help site,
        but doesn't everyone just search on google instead if it gets to that point? What I'm saying is that the help features for
        applications and sites should really be more useful. Like why even have a "Help" tab if it doesn't provide help? It's crazy to me.
