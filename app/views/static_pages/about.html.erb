<h1>About</h1>
<div class="row">
  <p>
    Why does this site exist? Well, originally I (Nick) wanted a place to talk about film. Then
    I realized that I have some talented friends that enjoy writing on a variety of cool topics. After minimal coercion they
    were on board to contribute to the site, and FML was born. We're totally not experts on this stuff, just some people
    that think we have a unique, funny, and accessible perspective on things. Enjoy!
