<div class="row">
  <p>
    Why does this site exist? Well, originally I (Nick) wanted to talk about film. After working on the site for a while,
    I realized it could be more. I have talented friends around me that also love to write, so why not
    put us together and put some stuff out there? We're definitely not experts on the things we write about, just guys interested in
    the topics and excited to start a conversation about a variety of things.
